Whitelisting
============

Whitelisting messages is disabled by default on the public server 
(``public.pyzor.org``). However if you want to request a whitelist you can 
use the web service at::

http://app.pyzor.org/whitelist/  

You need to upload the raw message and the corresponding pyzor message digest.
