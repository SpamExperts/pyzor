    *	Message normalization now removes HTML tags
	(irregardless of Content-Type).

    *	Message normalization now doesn't digest of lines
	less than 8 chars.

    *	If HOME is unspecified and no --homedir is given,
	The the config directory is /etc/pyzor


Noteworthy changes in 0.3.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Fixed bug where if pyzor would send reports or
	whitelists to each server N times, where N
	is the number of servers.

    *	Server now keeps database file open, instead of re-opening
	it on each request.

    *	pyzord.log now includes response code.


Noteworthy changes in 0.3.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Pyzor now requires Python 2.2.1.

    *	The protocol is not backwards compatible, so please
	remove old ~/.pyzor/servers files, and they will
	be refreshened to point to new servers.

    *	The pyzor system now has accounts, access controls on
	users.  anonymous users by default can do
	['check', 'report', 'ping', 'info'].
	For more information on this, please refer to the
	documentation.

    *	Documentation has moved from the source files
	(e.g., 'pydoc pyzor') into a separate XHTML document,
	located in docs/usage.html, and normally installed
	into a location such as /usr/share/doc/pyzor

    *	Messages are authenticated using digest-signing, similar
	to HTTP-digest authentication.  This is a
	is a shared-secret scheme, but the secret is very
	hard to recover from what is passed in the signature.

    *	Whitelisting messages is now possible.

    *	An 'info' command is no implemented
	This returns extra info about any digest, such as
	when it was first entered and last updated.

    *	a 'genkey' command has been implemented for the client;
	this is used to create a (salt, key) string
	used for authentication.

    *	a 'shutdown' commmand has been implemented, which can
	be used to shutdown a server.

    *	Expiring of digests using a USR1 signal has been removed
	for now.  In the future a client/server message
	will be likely be implemented for this functionality.

    *	pyzrod logfile now contains a human-readable timestamp
	field in addition to the epoch-seconds field.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *   Fixed major bug where the incorrect exit

	~/.pyzor/servers contains a list of servers.

    *	pyzord's command-line interface has changed,
	now being primarily configured in ~/.pyzor/config.

    *	pyzord now does logging (~/.pyzor/pyzord.log) and has
	a pidfile (~/.pyzor/pyzord.pid).

    *	Debugging for client and server improved.

    *	Client now contacts each server listed
	when doing a check/report/ping.

    *	Can now be used with ReadyExec,
